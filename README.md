My name is Isaiah. I am a Software/Web Developer based in Southern California.

I'm currently learning/specializing in Web Development and utilize the Web Framework Django Python

I am a former collegiate/professional baseball player and I majored in B.S. Advanced Computer Sceince Magna Cum Laude at Avila University in Kansas City, MO.

My main goal is to find any software engineering/IT employer that is willing to take a chance on me. It has been difficult trying
to find a job, especially due to my lack of hardware/software experience and current job market. I was not even able to participate in an
internship while I was in college due to the fact that I was playing baseball for the university as well as covid terminating internship opportunities. 

I'm still building my portfolio and building as many apps as I can in order learn more and gain experience.

So far, I've built a total of 3 websites PWAs and of those 3, 1 of them is a SaaS website that is also a mobile app for the iOS App Store📱

I've only just gotten started. Please reach out to me through my linkedin or instagram account so we can work together.
